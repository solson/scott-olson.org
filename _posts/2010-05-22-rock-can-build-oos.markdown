title: Rock Can Build oos!
---

For those of you that don't know, [rock](http://github.com/nddrylliog/rock) is
a compiler for the new [ooc language](http://ooc-lang.org/) that is itself
written in ooc (yay bootstrapping), and [oos](http://github.com/tsion/oos) is
my operating system written in ooc.

Today marks the first day rock was able to compile a fully working oos that
runs just like it's supposed to. Before today it could only be compiled with
the legacy j/ooc, which is the original ooc compiler written in Java. Kudos to
the main ooc man [nddrylliog](http://github.com/nddrylliog) for fixing the last
couple of bugs preventing rock from compiling oos.

I've already started using rock features that are not present in j/ooc, like
enums.
