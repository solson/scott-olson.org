# oos

oos is the ooc operating system. It's life began in November, 2009, as a C+ASM
OS based on the [dux operating system](http://github.com/RockerMONO/dux), but
with the goal of being written using no C at all. Soon after, this goal was
met, with the only C left in the OS being header files with packed structs.

The source code for oos is MIT licensed and hosted on
[GitHub](http://github.com/tsion/oos).
